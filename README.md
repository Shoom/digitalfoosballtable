# digitalfoosballtable 
⚽ ⚽ Taking an analog foosball table into the digital age.

## MVP

A few weeks ago we had a lot of amazing ideas for a next generation of digital foosball table.

We decided to have as first an MVP for JSKongress:

* counting goals
* show goals at a device (IPad / TV / Screen)
* show players via webcams at screen.

## [issues](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/digitalfoosballtable/issues) and [projects](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/digitalfoosballtable/projects) ##
Every Issues has to be sign to a project. At the moment we have two projects (has to be discuss)
* [MVP](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/digitalfoosballtable/projects/1)
* [After MVP](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/digitalfoosballtable/projects/2)

By adding the issues to the projects we will get a better overview.
Could be discussed if we have a project for software and one for hardware,
but I like the idea of have all at one place.
